The DJI Neo represents DJI's answer to a question most drone manufacturers ignore: what if you want to fly indoors, close to people, or in tight spaces where traditional drones feel dangerous? After extensive testing across indoor shoots, close-proximity filming, and social media content creation, I can confidently say the Neo solves real problems that other drones simply can't address.

What makes the Neo special isn't just its 135g weight—though that ultra-lightweight design changes everything about where and how you can fly. It's how DJI combined this portability with genuine imaging capabilities and multiple control options that make flying accessible to complete beginners.

## Design and Portability: The Weight Advantage

Unpacking the Neo for the first time feels like handling something that shouldn't be capable of flight. At 135g, this drone weighs less than most smartphones, yet it includes a full camera system, gimbal stabilization, and intelligent flight modes. The dimensions of 130×157×48.5mm mean it fits in spaces where even the Mini series feels bulky.

The full propeller guard isn't just a safety feature—it's what enables the Neo's unique use cases. When filming close to people or in confined spaces, the guard provides genuine protection that makes flying feel safe rather than risky. Build quality feels surprisingly solid despite the ultra-lightweight design, and the three-axis gimbal remains stable despite the drone's minimal weight.

## Flight Performance: Adequate for Its Purpose

The 18-minute flight time might sound short compared to the Mini series' 31 minutes, but in practice, it's sufficient for most Vlog and social media shooting scenarios. During real-world testing, I consistently achieved 14-16 minutes of usable flight time while maintaining safe battery reserves. For indoor shoots or close-proximity filming, you rarely need extended flight sessions, and the Neo's endurance matches its intended use cases.

The transmission system delivers reliable 720p live feed that feels stable for most shooting distances. The 7km maximum range (FCC) is largely theoretical for the Neo's use cases, but the system's reliability in various environments proves valuable. Wind resistance up to 8 m/s (Level 4) performs adequately for such a lightweight drone, though you'll want to avoid windy conditions.

## Camera System: Surprising Capability

The 1/2-inch CMOS sensor with 12MP resolution might seem modest, but the results exceed expectations for a $199 drone. During daylight conditions, the Neo produces sharp, vibrant images that rival those from more expensive entry-level drones. The 4K/30fps video quality maintains excellent detail and color accuracy, with smooth stabilization that belies the drone's minimal size.

What impressed me most was the 117.6° wide-angle lens with 14mm equivalent focal length. This ultra-wide perspective is perfect for Vlog shots, selfies, and capturing environmental context. The f/2.8 aperture provides reasonable low-light performance, though the smaller sensor limits results compared to larger drones. The RockSteady and HorizonBalancing electronic image stabilization work effectively, producing smooth footage. Low-light performance reveals the sensor size limitations, but for most users shooting during daylight hours or in well-lit indoor spaces—which represents the majority of Vlog content—this limitation matters less than you'd expect.

## Control Options: Accessibility Meets Flexibility

The Neo's multiple control options represent its most innovative feature. The ability to control the drone through the DJI Fly app's virtual joysticks, voice commands, or the optional RC-N3 remote controller means users can choose the method that feels most natural. Voice control works surprisingly well for basic commands, though it's not suitable for complex maneuvers. The DJI Fly app's virtual joystick control provides full functionality for users who prefer smartphone control, while the optional RC-N3 remote controller provides more precise control for extended shooting sessions.

## Intelligent Features: Making Professional Shots Accessible

The Neo's intelligent tracking and automated shooting modes create cinematic sequences with minimal effort. The Follow mode works well for Vlog shots, while the Circle and Rocket modes produce impressive results for social media content. The AI-powered subject tracking performs adequately for the Neo's use cases, providing sufficient capability without requiring advanced skills. The DJI Fly app provides an intuitive interface with flight tutorials, making the Neo particularly beginner-friendly.

## Comparison: Finding the Right Fit

The Mini 2's 31-minute flight time and longer transmission range justify the $449 price for users who need extended flight sessions. However, the Neo's 135g weight, full propeller guard, and multiple control options provide advantages that the Mini 2 can't match for indoor filming or close-proximity shots. The Mini 3's larger sensor and extended 51-minute flight time target more serious content creators, while the Neo prioritizes accessibility and ultra-portability.

## Honest Assessment: Pros and Cons

The Neo's ultra-lightweight design delivers genuine advantages that heavier drones can't provide. Indoor filming becomes genuinely safe, close-proximity shots become possible, and the multiple control options make flying accessible to complete beginners. The 4K video quality and wide-angle lens provide professional capabilities that entry-level users shouldn't expect at this price point. However, the 18-minute flight time limits extended shooting sessions, and the lack of obstacle avoidance requires careful piloting, especially for beginners. The smaller sensor limits low-light performance compared to larger drones, and the shorter transmission range means this isn't a drone for long-distance flying.

## Who Should Buy the Neo

The Neo excels for Vlog creators, social media content creators, and beginners who prioritize ultra-portability and safety for indoor or close-proximity filming. The 135g weight and full propeller guard make it ideal for indoor shoots and situations where traditional drones feel risky. Budget-conscious buyers who want professional-quality video without professional-level prices will find the Neo particularly appealing. However, users requiring maximum flight time, long-distance transmission, or advanced obstacle avoidance should consider higher-end models like the Mini series.

## Final Verdict

The DJI Neo earns a **4.3/5 star rating** based on extensive real-world testing. This rating reflects genuine achievement in creating a drone that solves specific problems that other models can't address, while maintaining imaging quality that exceeds expectations for the price point.

**Rating Breakdown:**
- **Camera Quality**: 4/5 - Excellent for entry-level, limited by sensor size in low light
- **Flight Performance**: 3.5/5 - Adequate for intended use cases, limited by short flight time
- **Portability**: 5/5 - Unmatched ultra-lightweight design with genuine safety advantages
- **Value**: 4.5/5 - Professional features at entry-level price
- **Ease of Use**: 5/5 - Multiple control options make flying accessible to beginners

For Vlog creators, social media content creators, and beginners who need ultra-portable, safe indoor filming capability, the Neo represents exceptional value. The combination of 4K video, wide-angle lens, multiple control options, and genuine safety features creates a package that serves specific needs better than more expensive alternatives. If you're choosing between the Neo and Mini series, the decision comes down to specific use cases—the Mini series offers superior flight time and outdoor capability, but the Neo provides unique advantages for indoor filming and beginner accessibility.
