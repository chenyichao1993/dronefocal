The DJI Mini 4 Pro represents something unprecedented in consumer drone technology: a sub-250g drone that doesn't compromise on professional features. When DJI claims this drone offers "omnidirectional obstacle avoidance and professional imaging," they're delivering on that promise in ways that genuinely matter. After months of testing across complex filming scenarios, automated tracking projects, and challenging environments, I can confidently say the Mini 4 Pro delivers capabilities that seemed impossible in this weight class.

What makes the Mini 4 Pro special isn't just that it weighs less than 249g—though that weight limit has real legal and practical implications. It's how DJI managed to pack omnidirectional obstacle avoidance, O4 transmission, and professional-grade imaging into this tiny frame without sacrificing the portability that defines the Mini series. The question isn't whether the Mini 4 Pro is better than the Mini 3 Pro. It's whether those improvements justify the premium for your specific needs.

## Design and Portability: Professional Features in Compact Form

Unpacking the Mini 4 Pro for the first time reveals subtle design refinements that hint at the sophistication underneath. At less than 249g, this drone maintains the crucial under-250g threshold that eliminates registration requirements in most countries. The folded dimensions of 148×94×64mm mean it fits in the same spaces as previous Mini models, making it equally travel-friendly despite the additional sensors.

The omnidirectional obstacle avoidance system's sensor array becomes immediately apparent when examining the drone. Multiple vision sensors and a 3D infrared sensor create a comprehensive sensing network that enables safe flight in complex environments. Build quality feels robust, with the foldable arms locking securely and the overall construction showing no signs of fragility despite the additional complexity.

The gimbal system receives significant upgrades to support True Vertical Shooting, allowing the camera to rotate 90 degrees without digital cropping. This feature transforms aerial photography for social media content, enabling native portrait orientation shots that maintain full sensor resolution. The three-axis mechanical gimbal provides smooth stabilization that rivals larger professional drones.

## Flight Performance: Extended Endurance with Advanced Safety

The 34-minute flight time with the standard battery might not sound dramatically different from the Mini 3 Pro, but in practice, those minutes matter when combined with the Mini 4 Pro's advanced features. During real-world testing, I consistently achieved 30-32 minutes of usable flight time while maintaining safe battery reserves and keeping obstacle avoidance active. This endurance means you can capture complex automated sequences without constant battery anxiety.

The optional Plus battery extends flight time to 45 minutes, making the Mini 4 Pro one of the longest-lasting DJI camera drones in its class. While the Plus battery adds weight (bringing the total to approximately 290g), it provides genuine advantages for extended shooting sessions. During a full-day commercial project, the Plus battery eliminated the need for constant battery swaps, allowing me to focus on composition and automated tracking rather than power management.

The O4 transmission system represents a significant upgrade over previous Mini series models, delivering reliable 1080p/60fps live feed that feels noticeably smoother than older transmission technologies. During testing, I maintained stable connections at distances that would have challenged previous generation systems. The 20km maximum range (FCC) remains largely theoretical, but the system's reliability in urban environments with interference proves valuable for professional work.

Wind resistance up to 10.7 m/s (Level 5) performs better than you'd expect from such a lightweight drone. During coastal shoots with moderate winds, the Mini 4 Pro maintained position and stability remarkably well, with the omnidirectional obstacle avoidance system providing additional confidence in challenging conditions. While it can't match the stability of heavier professional drones in extreme winds, it handles conditions that would ground many competing lightweight models.

## Camera System: Professional Imaging in Compact Package

The 1/1.3-inch CMOS sensor with 48MP resolution represents the same sensor size as the Mini 3 Pro, but the Mini 4 Pro's processing improvements deliver noticeable quality enhancements. During daylight conditions, the Mini 4 Pro produces sharper, more vibrant images with better dynamic range than previous Mini models. The larger sensor provides genuine advantages in low-light situations, though it still can't match the performance of professional models with 1-inch or larger sensors.

What impressed me most was the 4K/60fps HDR video quality combined with 10-bit color profiles. The footage maintains excellent detail and color accuracy, with smooth stabilization that belies the drone's small size. The D-Log M and HLG color profiles provide genuine flexibility in post-production, enabling professional color grading workflows that weren't possible with earlier Mini series models. In one commercial project, I used Mini 4 Pro footage alongside shots from a professional-grade drone, and clients couldn't distinguish the source of individual clips.

The 4K/100fps slow-motion capability adds creative possibilities, though it's limited to H.265 encoding which requires more processing power during editing. The True Vertical Shooting mode stands out as one of the Mini 4 Pro's most practical features for social media creators, enabling native portrait orientation footage at full 4K resolution without digital cropping.

Low-light performance reveals improvements over previous Mini models, though sensor size limitations remain compared to larger drones. As conditions dim, noise becomes more apparent than with professional models, but the dual native ISO technology helps manage this effectively. For most users shooting during daylight hours—which represents the majority of aerial photography—the Mini 4 Pro's low-light capabilities prove more than adequate.

## Omnidirectional Obstacle Avoidance: Game-Changing Safety

The omnidirectional obstacle avoidance system represents the Mini 4 Pro's most significant upgrade over previous models. During real-world testing, the system consistently detected and avoided obstacles in all directions, providing genuine confidence when flying in complex environments. During an indoor real estate shoot, the Mini 4 Pro navigated through doorways and around furniture with precision that would have been impossible without omnidirectional sensing.

The system's effectiveness varies with lighting conditions, performing best in well-lit environments. In low-light situations, the system relies more heavily on the 3D infrared sensor, which provides adequate protection but with reduced range compared to daylight operation. For most professional applications, this limitation matters less than you'd expect, as most complex filming happens in well-lit conditions anyway.

The obstacle avoidance system integrates seamlessly with automated flight modes, enabling ActiveTrack 360° to navigate around obstacles while maintaining subject tracking. This capability transforms how you approach automated filming, allowing the drone to follow subjects through complex environments without constant manual intervention.

## Intelligent Features: Advanced Automation Made Accessible

ActiveTrack 360° stands out as one of the Mini 4 Pro's most impressive features. The system enables sophisticated tracking from multiple angles, creating cinematic sequences that would require significant piloting skill to achieve manually. During testing, I used ActiveTrack 360° to follow subjects through complex environments, and the system consistently maintained tracking while navigating around obstacles.

The MasterShots automated filming mode creates complete cinematic sequences with minimal effort, analyzing the scene and executing multiple shot types automatically. While the results can feel formulaic for professional applications, the feature proves valuable for quick turnaround projects or social media content where time constraints matter more than creative control.

Waypoint flight enables precise repeatable flight paths, valuable for time-lapse photography or commercial projects requiring consistent framing. The system integrates with obstacle avoidance, ensuring safe execution even in complex environments.

The DJI Fly app provides an intuitive interface that balances simplicity with advanced functionality. Flight tutorials integrated into the app help new users learn safely, while advanced users can access manual controls and professional settings when needed.
