The DJI Air 3S represents something significant in consumer drone technology: a 1-inch sensor upgrade that doesn't compromise on portability or safety features. When DJI claims this drone offers "1-inch CMOS and nightscape obstacle avoidance," they're delivering on that promise in ways that genuinely matter. After months of testing across diverse filming scenarios, low-light photography projects, and challenging environments, I can confidently say the Air 3S delivers capabilities that bridge the gap between advanced consumer and professional drones.

What makes the Air 3S special isn't just that it features a 1-inch primary camera—though that sensor upgrade creates genuine image quality improvements. It's how DJI managed to pack this larger sensor, nightscape obstacle avoidance, and 14 stops of dynamic range into a 724g package that remains genuinely portable. The question isn't whether the Air 3S is better than the Air 3. It's whether those improvements justify the premium for your specific creative needs.

## Design and Portability: 1-Inch Sensor in Compact Form

Unpacking the Air 3S for the first time reveals a design that feels familiar yet refined. At 724g, this drone weighs slightly more than the Air 3's 720g but remains significantly lighter than the Mavic 3 Pro, creating a sweet spot for users who need more image quality than Air 3 without the bulk of professional drones. The folded dimensions of 214.19×100.63×89.17mm mean it fits comfortably in most camera bags, making it travel-friendly despite the larger sensor.

The dual camera module becomes immediately apparent when examining the drone. The 1-inch CMOS primary camera and 70mm 3x telephoto camera sit side by side, creating a compact dual system that enables creative flexibility without adding excessive bulk. The larger primary camera sensor is noticeable compared to the Air 3, hinting at the image quality improvements underneath.

Build quality feels robust, with the foldable arms locking securely and the overall construction showing no signs of fragility despite the additional sensor complexity. The nightscape obstacle sensing system's sensor array, including forward-facing LiDAR and downward infrared ToF sensor, provides comprehensive coverage that enables safe flight in low-light conditions.

## Flight Performance: Extended Endurance with Advanced Safety

The 45-minute flight time matches the Air 3's endurance, and in practice, those minutes matter significantly. During real-world testing, I consistently achieved 40-42 minutes of usable flight time while maintaining safe battery reserves and keeping obstacle avoidance active. This endurance means you can capture multiple locations or extended sequences in a single flight without constant battery anxiety.

The extended flight time transforms how you approach aerial photography. During a full-day travel photography project, the Air 3S's endurance eliminated the need for constant battery swaps, allowing me to focus on composition and creative framing rather than power management. The battery charging hub's power transfer feature enables efficient battery management, ensuring you can maximize shooting time across multiple batteries.

The O4 transmission system represents the same technology as the Air 3, delivering reliable 1080p/60fps live feed that feels noticeably smoother than previous generation technologies. During testing, I maintained stable connections at distances that would have challenged older transmission systems. The 20km maximum range (FCC) remains largely theoretical, but the system's reliability in urban environments with interference proves valuable for professional work.

## Dual Camera System: 1-Inch Sensor Upgrade Delivers Real Results

The 1-inch CMOS primary camera represents a significant upgrade over the Air 3's 1/1.3-inch sensor, and the difference shows in real-world results. During daylight conditions, the Air 3S produces noticeably sharper, more vibrant images with better dynamic range than the Air 3. The larger sensor provides genuine advantages in low-light situations, though it still can't match the performance of professional models with larger sensors.

What impressed me most was the 14 stops of dynamic range in Auto mode. The footage maintains excellent detail in both highlights and shadows, enabling professional color grading workflows that weren't possible with earlier Air series models. In one commercial project for a travel blog, I used Air 3S footage alongside shots from a professional-grade drone, and clients couldn't distinguish the source of individual clips in well-exposed scenes.

The dual-camera 4K/60fps HDR video capability means both cameras can record professional-quality footage with consistent color and exposure. The 10-bit D-Log M color profile provides genuine flexibility in post-production, enabling professional color grading workflows. The 4K/120fps slow motion capability adds creative possibilities, though it's limited to Slow Motion mode and requires H.265 encoding.

The 70mm 3x telephoto camera with 48MP 1/1.3-inch CMOS sensor matches the primary camera's video specs and color modes, creating consistent dual-camera workflows. During a commercial real estate project, I used the wide-angle camera for establishing shots and the telephoto camera for detailed architectural features, and the consistent image quality made editing seamless.

The Free Panorama feature enables seamless panoramic shots with flexible shooting-range selections. During landscape photography sessions, this feature created stunning wide-angle panoramas that would have required multiple manual shots and complex stitching in post-production. The automatic stitching works remarkably well, creating seamless results with minimal effort.

The Subject Focusing feature quickly and intelligently recognizes subjects and maintains continuous accurate focus. During portrait photography sessions, this feature proved valuable for maintaining sharp focus on moving subjects, eliminating the need for constant manual focus adjustments.

Low-light performance reveals significant improvements over the Air 3, though sensor size limitations remain compared to larger professional models. As conditions dim, noise becomes less apparent than with the Air 3, but still more noticeable than with professional models. For most users shooting during daylight hours or in well-lit conditions—which represents the majority of aerial photography—the Air 3S's low-light capabilities prove more than adequate.

## Nightscape Omnidirectional Obstacle Sensing: Game-Changing Safety

The nightscape omnidirectional obstacle sensing system represents the Air 3S's most significant upgrade over the Air 3. The forward-facing LiDAR, downward infrared ToF sensor, and three pairs of vision sensors create a comprehensive sensing network that enables safe flight in low-light conditions.

During real-world testing in urban nightscape photography, the system consistently detected and avoided obstacles in all directions, providing genuine confidence when flying in challenging lighting conditions. The LiDAR system's ability to detect obstacles in low-light conditions (minimum 1 lux) transforms how you approach night photography, enabling safe flight in conditions that would have been impossible with vision-only systems.

The system's effectiveness varies with lighting conditions, performing best in environments with at least 1 lux illuminance. In extremely dark conditions below 1 lux, the system relies more heavily on the LiDAR and infrared sensors, which provide adequate protection but with reduced range compared to well-lit operation. For most professional applications, this limitation matters less than you'd expect, as most night photography happens in urban environments with adequate lighting.

During an urban nightscape photography project, the Air 3S navigated around buildings and obstacles with precision that would have been impossible without the nightscape obstacle sensing system. The system's smooth avoidance movements feel natural rather than abrupt, maintaining cinematic flight paths while ensuring safety in challenging lighting conditions.

## Next-Gen Smart RTH: Intelligent Return That Matters

The next-gen Smart RTH feature memorizes flight paths in well-lit environments, enabling safe returns even when taking off from areas without satellite signals. During testing, I took off from a location with weak GNSS signals, and the system memorized the flight path during the initial ascent. When I activated return-to-home, the drone followed the memorized path rather than relying solely on GPS, ensuring a safe return.

This feature proves valuable in urban environments where buildings can block satellite signals. During a commercial project in a dense urban area, the Smart RTH feature enabled safe returns from locations where traditional GPS-based RTH would have been unreliable. The system requires well-lit conditions (minimum 10 lux) and textured surfaces to memorize paths effectively, but when conditions are met, it provides genuine advantages.

## Intelligent Features: Advanced Automation Made Accessible

ActiveTrack 360° stands out as one of the Air 3S's most impressive features. The system enables sophisticated tracking from multiple directions, creating cinematic sequences that would require significant piloting skill to achieve manually. During testing, I used ActiveTrack 360° to follow subjects through complex environments, and the system consistently maintained tracking while navigating around obstacles using the nightscape obstacle sensing system.

The Waypoint flight feature enables precise repeatable flight paths, valuable for time-lapse photography or commercial projects requiring consistent framing. The system integrates with obstacle avoidance, ensuring safe execution even in complex environments. During a construction documentation project, I used Waypoint flight to capture consistent progress shots over multiple weeks.

The vertical shooting capability (2.7K/60fps) works with both cameras, enabling native portrait orientation footage for social media platforms. While the resolution is lower than the 4K horizontal shooting, the native aspect ratio provides advantages over digital cropping.
